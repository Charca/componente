## Troubleshooting
If you're having problems installing fabric in OSX, you can do:

```
brew update

brew install cairo
brew link pixman
brew link cairo
```

Or follow the instructions here: https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation---OSX

Installing cairo and pixman through homebrew didn't work for me.
